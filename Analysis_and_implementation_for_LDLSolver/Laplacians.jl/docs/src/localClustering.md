# Local Clustering

This is a collection of clustering related algorithms,
  based on Approximate Personal PageRank, and improvement by local
  flow computations.
  It needs more documentation.

For now, see the [Local Clustering Notebook](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl/blob/master/notebooks/LocalClustering.ipynb)
